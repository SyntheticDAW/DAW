# Synthetic
synthetic is a modular digital audio workstation intended for modern generes like Scenecore, Hyperpop, and other virtual generes, but it will eventually be versatile.

It uses a modular, node and graph based effects system and simple, square layouts with a focus on settings instead of complex menubars.
